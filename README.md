# Hello!

This repository contains files or data required for the dissertation, except for the CDRC footfall data as it is safeguarded data. 
However, ESRI shapefile for London and GTFS are too large to upload to gihub, therefore, I am attaching the link to:
Transit feed for r5r package accessibility analysis https://gtfs.org/schedule/
London shapefile https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london
